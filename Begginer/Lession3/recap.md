Lession 3 recap:

- We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
- We've learned to protect core functions with onlyOwner
- We've learned about gas and gas optimization
- We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
- We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets-above a certain level
- And finally, we now have a function to return a user's zombie army
